# mi-card
business card app made with Flutter, inspired from mi-card exercise from [AppBrewery course](https://www.appbrewery.co/p/flutter-development-bootcamp-with-dart).

I liked the business card app, it reminded me of the webdev landing page, so I decided to make one. I just checked the general layout then tried to make a similar one.
