# mi-card
business card app made with Flutter, inspired from mi-card exercise from [AppBrewery course](https://www.appbrewery.co/p/flutter-development-bootcamp-with-dart).

I liked the business card app, it reminded me of the webdev landing page, so I decided to make one. I just checked the general layout then tried to make a similar one.

Since it was a pretty simple app, I decided to port it to Flutter Web. I first wanted to share the codebase, but this isn't currently possible, so I just copy/pasted my Flutter code to my Flutter Web project, then made changes to make the display responsive. I couldn't keep the links from the mobile app, because the url_launcher library isn't compatible with Flutter Web, and figuring out a workaround would have required more time than I had for this side project.
